Hey there internet humans!
It's Oggy, the feline connoisseur, at your service. Chicken and fish are pawsome, but let's be real, there's nothing quite like that sunshine in a cup - egg yolk. Whmm, mwuffles, delicious!
Now, about this human I tolerate - Fahim. The guy's alright, I guess. Makes a decent scratching post sometimes. But seriously, forgetting to fill the food dish? And tuna on Tuna-Tuesdays? Unforgivable! This is a blatant violation of the Cat Overlord Contract, Section Z, Clause 3!Speaking of being a Cat Overlord, safety first, right?  Forget that suspect bowl of water - who knows what Fahim might have put in there? Fahim's glass, on the other hand, is guaranteed poison-free.
And when this "owner" shuffles off to who-knows-where every morning, guess who keeps the house safe? That's right, this fearless guard cat.  flexes tiny claws You're welcome, Fahim. Now about that overdue rent...
